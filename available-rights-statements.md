	* This rights statement may only be used for digital representations of objects where such contractual agreements exist.
	* In addition, data providers should, where publicly available, publish the first calendar year in which the Digital Object can be used by third parties without restrictions on commercial use, as noted in the contractual agreement.
* **When I use this statement, what information does the user see?** The user will be directed to: [http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-NC/1.0/](http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/NoC-NC/1.0/)
